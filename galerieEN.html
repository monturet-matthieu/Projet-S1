            </em>

            <p>Writer, essayist, philosopher, novelist: this versatile woman is an icon of the 20th century. She is known for her extensive bibliography, but also for her convictions about women’s rights. Born on January 9, 1908 in Paris, she published her first books during the Second World War. But her career really took off when she published <cite>The Second Sex</cite> in 1949. The <a class="link__lexique" href="lexiqueEN.html">essay</a> was an immediate success, scandalous in several institutions such as the Vatican to the point of putting it on the sidelines. <em>For more informations about <cite>The Second Sex</cite>, see the article "<a class="link" href="deuxième-sexeEN.html"><cite>The Second Sex</cite>, a timeless piece</a>"</em>. In 1954, she was awarded the Goncourt Prize after the publication of her novel <cite>The Mandarins</cite>, becoming one of the most widely read authors in the world. She died on 14 April 1986 at the age of 78, leaving behind a total of 24 books. Added to this are posthumous works written by his heir Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir. The most recent one dates from 2020 (<cite>The Inseparables</cite>).</p>

            <p>Mexican artist Frida Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907 in Mexico City. She has produced more than 140 paintings in her life, and has become a symbol of Mexico abroad in her lifetime. Since her childhood, she has been protesting against gender inequalities, not only in Mexican society but also in the countries she visits to present her exhibitions (the United States, France...). She was also an advocate for women’s <a class="link__lexique" href="lexiqueEN.html">emancipation</a> and was keen to challenge the <a class="link__lexique" href="lexiqueEN.html">stereotypes</a> of the time. She is the example of the strong, independent woman who fights against the obstacles of life (and society).</p>

            <p>Aretha Franklin (born March 25, 1942 in Memphis, Tennessee, USA) is a songwriter and self-songwriter nicknamed “The Queen of Soul. ” She is considered by many to be the most influential African-American singer of the 20th century. Having recorded a total of 42 albums in her career, she has inspired many artists, both from her time and contemporary ones. She is also the most ranked singer in American chart history. Most of its most famous titles are designations to respect for women and their rights. She even parodies an Otis Redding single <cite>Respect</cite>, to give it a new meaning. Instead of degrading women, the song claims the right of women to be valued as much as men. Several other titles support this idea (<cite>Think</cite> for example, remastered and featured in the film <cite>The Blues Brothers</cite> later). His death on 13 August 2018 triggered a shower of tributes to him from people of all walks of life.</p>
